*Would you like to build an ironman?*

Hey fellow human/bot!\
I am Kshitijaa Jaglan - an undergraduate research student at [International Insitute of Information Technology](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). My interests lie in AI/ML, ethics, philosophy, human computer interaction, open source, oh and yes definitely \[TW?\] [cats](https://cataas.com/cat/gif) too.

I am fascinated by everything space, quantum and cybersecurity. A related fun fact: In high school I found a vulnerability in the website of an educational event (in affiliation with some departments of the Government of India) which was leaking data of about 100k students *(don't sue me, I responsibly reported it XD)*. Apart from this, I also like to skate and waveboard at times and would always be up for cycling.
