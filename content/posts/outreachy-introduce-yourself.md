Hey fellow human/bot!\
I am Kshitijaa Jaglan - an undergraduate research student at [International Insitute of Information Technology](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). Professionally, my areas of study lie in AI/ML, ethics, philosophy, human computer interaction, open source, oh and yes definitely \[TW?\] [cats](https://cataas.com/cat/gif) too.

I am fascinated by everything space, quantum and cybersecurity. A related fun fact: In high school I found a vulnerability in the website of an educational event (in affiliation with some departments of the Government of India) which was leaking data of about 100k students *(don't sue me, I responsibly reported it XD)*. Apart from this, I also like to skate and waveboard at times and would always be up for cycling.

Also yes, I am in LOVE with everything Japan and the beauty of minimalistic design. The solid shades of pastel and simplicity tend to catch my attention for some reason and tend to be my guides in many of the artistic pursuits. One of the would be [Japanese Learning](https://deutranium.github.io/Japanese-Practice/) which I made during high school to help me practice my hiragana skills. I have also tried my hand at origami but lost touch since a past few months -- hoping to catch this up soon too.

### Core Values
Damn this was a huge task to narrow down the values to three XD. Somehow I ended up with the following:
- **Curiosity:** Well curiosity killed the cat but curiosity also made [it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat) both dead and alive at the same time. Pretty sure the last sentence was irrelevant but regardless, curiosity has allowed me to explore domains I never thought I will and made me a more "complete" person by exposing me to world outside my own social bubble.
- **Optimism:** Trust me, the world has been testing this one for over an year with lockdowns and COVID cases but ehh it also made me realise how optimist I can be despite the circumstances and have that fire to keep my head over the water.
- **Adventure:** YOLO? Actually this is the quality which helps me make most of my "bad" decisions -- well you only live once (right?) so why not? At the same it also allows me to seek more thrill and fun in everything so a ends up being a win by the end.

### What motivated me to apply for Outreachy
Initially I had decided to mainly focus on GSoC and planned to not even apply for Outreachy. This soon took quite an unexpected turn after discussions with some of my seniors and going through blog posts of previous interns which made me pretty excited about the whole process and the community.

Co-incidently, I applied for both GSoC and Outreachy and got selected for both. So the final call was upto the organisations that I'd be working for. For Outreachy it was TensorFlow as compared to Python Software Foundation for GSoC. Both were pretty good orgs with good missions, but the TensorFlow one was more suited and a good learning path for my long term plans and tada! here I am.
