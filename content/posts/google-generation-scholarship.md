Hey fellow human/bot!\
After posting about my selection for Google Generation Scholarship, I have received many questions about the process, experience, etc. and in this blog post I will try to answer the same!

So LET'S GGGGOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

## What is it?
After going through many name changes like AnitaB.Org Scholarship, Google Women Techmakers etc, the Google Generation Scholarship is meant *"for women in computer science .... to help aspiring students pursuing computer science degrees excel in technology and become leaders in the field"*[^1]

## The Process
The entire application spans a couple of months with the following rounds:

### Round 1 - Resume and Essay Shorlisting
As the name suggests, the applicants will submit their resume and essays with the following prompts:
- Please give us one example of how you have exhibited leadership. Explain what you were trying to achieve, your role, how you influenced others, and the impact as a result of your actions. Think broadly and examine the many ways you are having an effect on the members of the different communities you are a part of. Keep in mind, the example you choose does not need to be a formal or traditional leadership role.
- What is a significant challenge that you believe women in the tech industry face, and how do you see yourself as being part of the solution(s) to this challenge? Keep in mind that impact can happen in many ways and at different scales.

#### A few suggestions
**Resume** \
Try to tailor your resume towards one of the main focusses of this scholarship - **community**. In its entirity, your resume should have elements of both your **technical awareness** in any field of **CS** while ensuring that it highlights your involvement in the community. This can be through **volunteering** experience, or involvement in college clubs or anything else you've done outside your curriculum.

**Essays** \
During my interview, I was told that my essays were really well **structured** which caught the interviewer's eye and I believe this should be one of the main focus points in general. Try to look at your essays from the point of view of the reviewer. After going through tens and hundereds of documents, your essay should have something which catches the eye at the first glance - and yes, proper structure and **formatting** does exactly this. \
Be honest in what you write and reveiew it as an external person yourself while marking what you would want in an applicant - this has helped me a lot in my application process.

### Round 2 - Interview
After getting shortlisted in the previous round, this round will be a 30 minute conversation with none other than a **Googler**!! \
I don't think we're allowed to share the exact questions so I won't be mentioning that; but in general they were around **how you started your journey in CS, what you like about it etc.** I was able to answer these questions with my journey into the field of CS and why I decided to pursue it for higher education. Try to give **examples from your life** as much as possible and be **honest and structured** in your explanations.\
After the CS related questions, my interviewer was convinced with how **passionate** I was about CS and moved on to ask **community and leadership** related questions. In these too, I tried to answer them through various **incidents from my life** where I believe I showed good community involvement and leadership qualities. These examples need not be those from a position of power, but even resolving a fight between your classmates can be a good example of leadership.\
Overall, my interview experience was AMAZING! My interviewer was really warm hearted and helped me formulate my thoughts well while ensuring I give it my best :)

If selected in both these rounds and after compliance reviews, WOOHOOOOOO YOU ARE A GOOGLE GENERATION SCHOLAR!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!
