Designed and implemented a discord bot to **manage transactions** by over **20 organizers** for more than **70 participants** in an intra-college event

The bot was used **Discord.py** and connected to **SQLite** for data storage. It was hosted and used in the event server with options to **view the scoreboard, change scores, view history** etc.
