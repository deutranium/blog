Since I wanted a WhatsApp app for Ubuntu and **couldn't find any official package**, I decided to **create one** using the **Chromium command line application** and the **Ubuntu `.desktop` configurations**

The code uses an **electron wrapper** to implement the web version of WhatsApp as a standalone app which can be used with any other Linux distro too (with minor modifications)
