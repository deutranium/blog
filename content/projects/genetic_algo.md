Created and trained a genetic algorithm written from scratch in Python in a team of two. The process included understanding the utility of one type of function over the other and how everything should be structured for optimal training. The decisions to modify and choose various algorithms over the other also helped me gain insight into why one might be preferred over the other in some cases and vice versa along.
The project also involved training the algorithm over an unknown dataset with only the validation and train error being provided. This allowed us to weigh various factors and errors leading to an overall rank of #12 out of over 110 teams on the leaderboard.
