<sub>*Team project with [Rishabh](https://github.com/RishKhanna/) as a part of Machine, Data and Learning (Spring'21)*</sub>

**Implemented** a genetic algorithm with functions like **crossover, mutation**, etc. to come up with new populations based on best features.

Trained the function on a **hidden dataset** with only training and validation error being provided and got a best rank of **9 out of over 110 teams**
